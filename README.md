# Randomizer for maya



Small script designed to give a more organic feel to larger sets (stones, bricks, bushes), however it does not deal with overlaping.
It will move/ scale/ rotate only polygonal objects in a selection and skip over others (ie. ligts, cameras...) and it has a nifty restore button for easy experimentation.
